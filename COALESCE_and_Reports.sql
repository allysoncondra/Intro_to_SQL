-- 1. Generate to query this output:
		-- Display Country name, 4-digit year, count of Nobel prize winners (where the count is â‰¥ 1), and country size:
			-- Large: Population > 100 million
			-- Medium: Population between 50 and 100 million (inclusive)
			-- Small: Population < 50 million
		-- Sort results so that the country and year with the largest number of Nobel prize winners appear at the top.
		-- Export the results as a CSV file.
		-- Use Excel to create a chart effectively communicating the findings.

-- 2. Create the output below that shows a row for each country and each year. Use COALESCE() to display unknown when the gdp is NULL.

SELECT
	country,
	LEFT(year,4) AS calendar_year,
	COALESCE(gdp::NUMERIC::MONEY::TEXT, 'unknown') AS gdp_amount
FROM
	country_stats AS cs
INNER JOIN
	countries AS c
ON
	c.id = cs.country_id
ORDER BY
	country_id, year;
